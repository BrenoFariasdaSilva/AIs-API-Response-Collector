Here are the rules for creating Python variables:

**1. Variable Names:**

* **Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).**  
   * Example: `my_variable`, `_count`, `name`
* **Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores.**
   * Example: `my_variable1`, `count_2`, `_total`
* **Cannot contain spaces or special characters (like !@#$%^&*).**
   * Example: `my variable` (incorrect), `my_variable!` (incorrect)
* **Case-sensitive.**
   * Example: `myVariable` is different from `myvariable`

**2. Reserved Keywords:**

* You cannot use Python's reserved keywords as variable names. These are words that have special meaning in the language.
   * Examples: `if`, `else`, `for`, `while`, `def`, `class`, `import`, `return`, etc.

**3. Best Practices:**

* **Use descriptive names:** Make your variable names clear and easy to understand.
   * Example: `customer_name` is better than `c`
* **Use lowercase with underscores:** This is the standard convention for Python variables.
   * Example: `my_variable`
* **Avoid single-letter variable names:** Unless they are very clear in context (like loop counters).

**4. Data Types:**

* Python is dynamically typed, meaning you don't need to explicitly declare the data type of a variable. The interpreter infers the type based on the value assigned.
   * Example:
     ```python
     my_number = 10  # Integer
     my_string = "Hello"  # String
     my_list = [1, 2, 3]  # List
     ```

**5. Assignment:**

* Use the assignment operator (`=`) to assign a value to a variable.
   * Example: `my_variable = 10`

**Example:**

```python
# Valid variable names
my_variable = 10
_count = 0
name = "Alice"

# Invalid variable names
1st_variable = 10  # Starts with a number
my-variable = 20  # Contains a hyphen
class = "Math"  # Reserved keyword
```
